# Web based media browser

Media browser app with an ability to play/watch tracks' videos inline.

## To run the application

To run and preview project locally please run:

### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Please note that before running those npm commands above you need to have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine. 

## Tech stack

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is used for front-end.

* Styling is written in [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide).

## Architecture decisions and considerations

1. API endpoint `https://openwhyd.org/hot?format=json` was generated by following the [Openwhyd documentation](https://openwhyd.github.io/openwhyd/API#hot-tracks).

1. The API endpoint was blocked by CORS policy on the Openwhyd end, so all data was placed into `openwhyd-hot-tracks-api-response.json` file and imported into App.js file. All the commented out code in App.js was written for the case if data would be fetched from the API endpoint.

## Issues encountered

1. The API endpoint was blocked by CORS policy. I raised a support request with Openwhyd on Github, but never got an answer: https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd/issues/331.

## Thinking process and steps taken

1. Checked what is returned in JSON and mapped the data to the desired fields being output.

1. Decided to output user details first as no action needed on the data that was being output.

1. Dived deeper into the Openwhyd documentation to see how to output extra data like the user's avatar and profile URL.

1. Tried to make all data output work first before moving to the playing/consuming track functionality.

1. Checked parts of the documentation explaining the [syntax of `ied` identifiers](https://openwhyd.github.io/openwhyd/API#syntax-of-eid-identifiers).

1. Checked the YouTube and SoundCloud APIs and embed options.

1. Timewise decided to go with the iframe embed options for track play/consumption.

1. From the [list of hosting track/video sources](https://openwhyd.github.io/openwhyd/API#syntax-of-eid-identifiers) only implemented tracks playback for YouTube and SoundCloud due to lack of time. And when checking JSON data returned from the API endpoint there were no more other source platforms used apart from YouTube and SoundCloud.

1. Added SASS styling to the application (responsive, mobile first).

1. Tested the project in latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE11 as well as responsive aspects. Encounters and fixed IE11 issues as latest ES6 scripts are not supported by adding react-app-polyfill.

## Possible improvements

1. Fix the API fetching functionality.
 
1. Have a track thumbnail and custom play button to play tracks via souce platforms APIs rather than play embedded videos.

1. Add the play bar.

1. Currently loading only the last 20 tracks, so would add a Load more functionality that every time gets the previous 20 tracks.

1. Break down <Track> component to even more components.

1. Write more tests.
